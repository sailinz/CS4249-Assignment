                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5em">On behalf of the National University of Singapore, we welcome you. Please pay careful attention to the instructions as they include important information about today’s experiment.</p>

                    <p><b>Purpose of the experiment: </b>You are taking part in a scientific experiment by the National University of Singapore for course CS4249. This experiment helps us to collect reliable data for analysing how the new copy-paste technique AutoComPaste perform compare with traditional copy-paste technique (Ctrl-C + Ctrl-V).<p>
                    <p><b>Investigators: </b>ZHONG Sailin. Email: E0210457@e.nus.edu</p>
                    <p><b>Experiment length: </b>We anticipate that the experiment will take around 45 min</p>
                    <p><b>Compensation: </b>This is a voluntary experiment and there is no compensation.</p>
                    <p><b>Confidentiality: </b>Information will be kept confidential by the investigators.  Names or other identifying or identified information will not be kept with the data.  The only other use will be to include excerpts or copies in the assignment submitted, but names and other identifying or identified information will not be submitted. </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5em"><b>Rules and Regulations: </b>If you have any questions during the study, please raise your hand and wait for an experimenter to come to you. Please refrain from communicating with other participants during the experiment. </p>

                    <hr>

                    <h4><b>Today’s experiment consists of two stages: </b></h4>

                    <p><b>Preparation: </b>There will be 6 trials for you to be familiar with the AutoComPaste technique and 2 trials for you to view the Traditional (Ctrl+C + Ctrl+V) technique before the timed experiment. </p>
                    <p>You may encounter the combination of the following conditions during the experiment: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Technique: </b>AUTOCOMPASTE/ TRADITIONAL</li>
                      <li><b>Granularity: </b>sentence/ phrase/ paragraph</li>
                      <li><b>Number of open windows: </b>single/ multiple</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will also be asked to save the data of the following session in this computer. Please save it under ../Desktop/CS4249_data folder.</p>

                    <p>In the experiment session, you will see be able to see the the experiment conditions (technique, granularity and number of open windows), and experimental trial on the left sector. On the right sector, there are two kinds of windows in the right section: 1) Text Editor window and 2) Articles window for you to view the articles which contains the stimuli and paste the results. Please see the details below. </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Stimuli: </b>•	The words in the red box. This is the target text that the you have to enter into the Text Editor window using one of the two techniques. Please do not manually type the full text in. </li>
                        <center><img src="img/stimuli.png" alt="Stimuli img" style="max-width:230px;margin-bottom:2em;"></center>
                      <li><b>Text Editor window: </b>The window that is meant for you to enter their response to the stimuli using either one of the proposed copy-pasting techniques. 
                        <p style="margin-top:1em;">When the AUTOCOMPASTE technique is active, typing three characters or more in the Text Editor will show a dropdown list of possible sentences that contain the characters/sentence that you have just entered, which are extracted from the contents of the open windows. Pressing the <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> buttons on the keyboard will scroll through the list of suggestions. Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to select a suggestion and the text editor will display the full selected sentence. <b>The suggestions only contain sentences. If you are asked to copy a phrase, please delete the unwanted words. </b></p>
                        <center><img src="img/3char.png" alt="Enter three characters img" style="max-width:600px;margin-bottom:2em;"></center>
                        <p>After selecting a sentence, pressing <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> button right after pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>, you can delete/append the next few sentences of the article to the Text Editor. Pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> would mean pasting the final text to the system.</p>
                        <center><img src="img/sentence.png" alt="Enter three characters img" style="max-width:600px;margin-bottom:2em;"></center>
                        <p>When the technique is TRADITIONAL, the AUTOCOMPASTE technique is de-active. You can select the stimuli from the article, do <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> (<kbd>Command⌘+C</kbd> for Mac) to copy, and <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> (<kbd>Command⌘+C</kbd> for Mac) to paste in the Text Editor.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Articles window: </b>The articles windows contain text in various forms (point-form / essay). The text corresponding to the stimuli will be <mark style="background-color: yellow;">highlighted in yellow</mark> for both techniques. You may see single article window as the examples above or multiple windows as per below. </li>
                        <p></p>

                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5em"><b>Timed experiment: </b>You will go through 2 blocks of experiments with a 2 min break in between. Each blocks of the experiment will have 36 trials. After you are satisfied with the text entered in the text editor, pressing the <b>Next Task</b> button will load the next trial with its respective conditions. Once you finished the 2 blocks of 36 trials, you will be asked to saved your experiment data and will be directed to the Post-Experiment questionnaire.</p>
